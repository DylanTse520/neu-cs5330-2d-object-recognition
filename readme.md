# Project 3: Real-time 2D Object Recognition
This is Project 3: Real-time 2D Object Recognition by Yixiang Xie for CS5330 Pattern Recognition & Computer Vision.

The code is written in C++ with OpenCV4 on Visual Studio Code on macOS Sonoma 14.0 and compiled with a CMakeLists.txt file.

# Run the code
In order to run the code, use command line to run the bash script by ```./run.sh```. To try different configurations, change ```./run.sh``` in the format of ```2DObjRecog <--km> <--knn=[value] ```. The --km is optional to enable k-means adaptive segmenting. The --knn is optional to enable k-nearest neighboring classifier.

# Extensions
For extensions, I developed a GUI to help labeling objects. Press n to enable this. I also developed k-means adaptive segmenting. Use --km to enable this.
